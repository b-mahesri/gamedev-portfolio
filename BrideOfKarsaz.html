							<h2>What you get when you assign a rapid prototype of an original game to a homesick Karachi-ite.</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/karsaz.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Task:</h3>
							<p>Individually build a rapid prototype of an original game in 2 weekly sprints:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>gold spike</li>
									<li>gold</li>
								</ol>
							<h3>The Idea:</h3>
							<p>I grew up in Karachi, Pakistan. Before I am anything, I am from Karachi. And at the end of a tough day I can take comfort and pride in knowing that in Karachi, I'm a good driver.</p>
							<p>On the streets of Karachi, chaos reigns supreme. You need excellent spacial awareness. You need to know the unspoken traffic rules almost better than you need to know the official law. And you need to know when to honk. Honk right, and even the sea will part for you in Karachi. It is not rude, it is necessary. And this served as the perfect premise for my original game.</p>
							<p>I combined the experience of driving in Karachi with a popular urban legend of a specter bride, who lost her husband to-be on the night of their wedding. Her spirit relentlessly haunts unfortunate travellers on the Karsaz road, clad still in her red wedding gown.</p>
							<h3>Reflections:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>I enjoyed gaining experience with event based programming and using the pub/sub method</li>
									<li>Draw from and build on what you know for creativity and inspiration.</li>
									<li>You will do your best, your most relentless and laser focused work when you're having fun.</li>
									<li>If you want to avoid being overwhelmed in the beginning, define all your tasks and be as specific as possible about what completion looks like.</li>
									<li>Sometimes it helps to be un-optimistic about estimating how long something will take you :)</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>Result:</h3>
							<ul class="actions">
								<li><a href="https://bmahesri.itch.io/the-bride-of-karsaz" class="button large">Play</a></li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Tech Stack and Project Management Tools:</h3>
							<p>Unity3D Game Engine, Visual Studio, C#, GitHub, Jira</p>
