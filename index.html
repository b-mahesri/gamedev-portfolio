							<h1>Batool Mahesri's Portfolio of Games</h1>
							<p>In December 2023 I was by no means a gamer. I could recall the early 2010s when I was playing Super Mario Bros. and Mario Kart on my Nintendo DS, Just Dance 2 and Lego Batman 2 on the Wii, and Boom Beach on a hand me down iPhone 3G. But that's all I could talk about if someone were to ask me about video games at that time.</p>
							<p>When I was deciding which upper level CS courses to take for Winter 2024 in my Junior year, and saw EECS 494: Introduction to Game Development, it didn't immediately seem like it was intended for me. But 2 things struck me (and my hubris): 1) The incredible projects made by previous students and 2) the fact that the course workload was labeled "extremely heavy". How do you make something like that? And how hard could it possibly be?</p>
							<p>I got satisfying answers to both those questions...</p>
							<p>At the time of your reading this I'm still by no means a gamer. But these projects are the result of some of the most creative, back-breaking, joyful, frustrating, technical, collaborative and delirious days of software development I've experienced and I'm deeply proud of them.</p>
