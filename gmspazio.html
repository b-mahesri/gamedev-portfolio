							<h1 class="major">Internship @ GMSpazio</h1>		
							<p>GMSpazio is an aerospace and defense software company in Rome, Italy. I interned in-person, May - July 2024.</p>
							<h3>My Job:</h3>
								<p>To redesign and reimplement the UI in a module of the desktop application product called Shield Master, a tool for missile defense system simulation and evaluation. The UI provided functionality to enter, store and view information regarding different missiles.</p>
								<p>For company context, the task had previously been assigned to a developer outside GMSpazio, but the team was very unhappy with the result and decided it had to be scrapped and redone. Owing to my previous experience with C# and UI design in game development, they gave me the opportunity to take it on.</p>
							<h3>My Process:</h3>
								<p>I started with reviewing the scrapped UI with my senior colleague to understand the functional and aesthetic issues and expectations. Beyond this I was expected to work relatively independantly and with limited oversight.</p>
								<p>I then reviewed the UI by myself and made a list of issues that would essentially become my manual issue tracker throughout the internship (In hindsight I should've used a project management tool like Jira as the additional step of estimating effort on each issue would have kept me more organised). I made sketches for new components and layouts, studied the Bunifu/WinForms UI framework, and wrote pseudocode for best implementation within it. By this point as a developer I knew UI can’t be built in isolation, specially when you're new to it, so I was intentional about asking questions and for feedback from my senior colleagues throughout the process, which I used as checkpoints as I built iteratively.</p>
							<h3>Result:</h3>
                				<p>The UI I delivered was integrated into the updated Shield Master released in late 2024, and used as a template for updating the UI in the other programs served by GMSpazio.</p>
							<h3>Reflections:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>It's not just about pumping out work. Pay attention to the people you work with, the rhythm of the space, and make the effort to match it. Collaboration, mentorship and productivity will flow out of this naturally.</li>
									<li>Be more curious. Ask questions about the company, the products, the processes and not just about how to solve the next problem.</li>
									<li>Plan your tasks and estimate your effort more intentionally when you begin a project, specially when you're new to a tech stack, and specially when you have independance in what you're building.</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
							  <p>C#, WinForms UI Framework, Bunifu, Visual Studio</p>
