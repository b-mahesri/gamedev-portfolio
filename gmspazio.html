							<h1 class="major">Internship @ GMSpazio</h1>		
							<p>GMSpazio is an aerospace and defense software company in Rome, Italy. I interned in-person, May - July 2024.</p>
							<h3>My Job:</h3>
								<p>To redesign and reimplement a module of the desktop application product called Shield Master, a tool for missile defense system simulation and evaluation. The UI provided functionality to enter, store and view information regarding different missiles.</p>
								<p>For company context, the task had previously been assigned to a developer outside GMSpazio, but the team was very unhappy with the result and decided it had to be scrapped and redone. Owing to my previous experience with C# and UI design in game development, they gave me the opportunity to take it on.</p>
							<h3>My Process:</h3>
								<p>I started with reviewing the scrapped UI with my senior colleague to understand the functional and aesthetic issues and expectations. Beyond this I was expected to work relatively independantly and with limited oversight.</p>
								<p>I then reviewed the UI by myself and made a list of issues that would essentially become my manual issue tracker throughout the internship (In hindsigh I should've used a project management tool like Jira as the additional step of estimating effort on each issue would have kept me more organised). I made sketches for new components and layouts, studied the Bunifu/WinForms UI framework, and wrote pseudocode for best implementation within it. By this point as a developer I knew UI can’t be built in isolation, specially when you're new to it, so I was intentional about asking questions and for feedback from my senior colleagues throughout the process, which I used as checkpoints as I built iteratively.</p>
							<h3>Result:</h3>
                				<p>The UI I delivered was integrated into the updated Shield Master released in late 2024, and used as a template for updating the UI in the other programs served by GMSpazio.</p>
							<h3>Tech Stack:</h3>
							  <p>C#, WinForms UI Framework, Bunifu, Visual Studio</p>
