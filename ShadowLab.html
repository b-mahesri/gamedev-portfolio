							<h2>6 weeks. 4 team members. 1 Original Game Capstone Project.</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/shadow-lab-thumbnail.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<h3>Task:</h3>
							<p>Collaborate in a team of 4, over 6 weeks to build a complete original game:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>gold spike</li>
									<li>milestone 1</li>
									<li>milestone 2</li>
									<li>alpha</li>
									<li>beta</li>
									<li>gold</li>
								</ol>
							<h3>The Idea:</h3>
							<p>We wanted to explore spatial audio in our game, and we landed on a stealth horror game based around it. Using both Unity’s built in audio spatialization tools and the Steam Audio toolkit we aimed to create an immersive auditory experience that would be meant to guide the player through the game to eventually escape a Soviet laboratory they find themselves stuck in.</p>
							<h3>Our Process:</h3>
							<p>Once Maddie, Michelle, Vanessa and I had decided on the idea, the process was essentially a combination of our experiences and what he had learnt in our previous group and individual projects.  We created a list of tasks, assigned priority to them, estimated effort and divided them between ourselves. Some programming we completed remotely while remaining in communication, but most development we compeleted together in person. After each sprint and the subsequent playtests with our fellow students, we met to discuss what we needed to work on and focus on next, revaluated how we defined our tasks, priorities and effort estimations, and then repeated the process.</p>
							<p>But it wasn't really so straightforward, and as obvious as they are the following bear repeating. Unlike the Metroid Re-implementation, we didn't know what we were building. Unlike the rapid prototype, we weren't building alone. This was by far the hardest thing I've ever worked on. We over-reached on our scope in the first couple of weeks and after going below our expectations in the playtests we were redefining our game almost every week. It became so very clear why this course workload was labeled "extremely heavy". We weren't always as organised as we should've been and there were a few occasions where we got the ball rolling late. We took on building a narrative game, probably the hardest thing we couldv'e tried to do in the short amounts of time we had. All while managing communication, meeting in person, keeping the repo clean and learning new skills and tools.</p>
							<p>And after all the exhaustion and details that we couldn't quite flush out, this is something I'm extremely proud having been a part of and built. And this showed me how much fun collaboration can be and how important it is to me.</p>
							<h3>My Contributions:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Player decisions, and level progression design and implementation</li>
									<li>Narrative and script</li>
									<li>Enemy design, mechanics and implementation</li>
									<li>"Set design and props" for game world</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>Reflections:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>There is no such thing as a bad user. Intuitive Design == Your Responsibility.</li>
									<li>Creativity is hard.</li>
									<li>Your teammates are the best resources for technical growth, for keeping you accountable, for growing your ideas, and for chocolate chai.</li>
									<li>Take ownership of what you build and build something you would love to use.</li>
									<li>Total agreement on everything is not normal. Talk it out.</li>
									<li>(Reiterating) Invest in organising your codebase from the get go.</li>
									<li>(Reiterating) Communicate consistently with your team. Be it simply communicating progress, asking for help, discussing a new idea or concern, or brainstorming an approach to a problem.</li>
								</ul>
							<h3>Result:</h3>
							<ul class="actions">
								<li><a href="https://micng.itch.io/shadow-lab" class="button large">Play</a></li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Tech Stack and Project Management Tools:</h3>
							<p>Unity3D Game Engine, Visual Studio, C#, GitHub, Jira</p>
